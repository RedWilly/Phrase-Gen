# Phrase-Gen

### Gen_V1.js 

generate random phrases using words from a dictionary file and save them to a separate file.
This script loads the dictionary.txt file into an array, and then generates a random phrase by selecting a random number of words between 2 and 6 from the dictionary and joining them with a space. Italso use (*set*) to keep track of the words that have been used in the generated phrases. It continues generating phrases until the set has at least twice as many elements as the dictionary.

### Gen_V2.js

This code on ther other hand uses three separate dictionaries for nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and randomly selects words from these dictionaries to create the phrases. This should help increase the chances of generating grammatically correct phrases.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance. #BCH - Man
