# Phrase-Gen

### Gen_V1.js 

generate random phrases using words from a dictionary file and save them to a separate file.
This script loads the dictionary.txt file into an array, and then generates a random phrase by selecting a random number of words between 2 and 6 from the dictionary and joining them with a space. Italso use (*set*) to keep track of the words that have been used in the generated phrases. It continues generating phrases until the set has at least twice as many elements as the dictionary.
